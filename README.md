# movie-db-site

### This is a team project. Together with other 3 students we create an interactive movie website. On this website we can filter the movies or we can see specific features of the movies such as directors or actors.

### We learn how to access and process the data in the given database in order to display the movies as requested.

### We also learn how to write HTML code and DOM(Document Object Model) manipulation.
